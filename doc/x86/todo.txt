Planned (and very desired and useful) features:

    * Add page markers to tell .text pages from .data/.bss ones
    * Sanitize userspace-kernel interaction in syscalls
    * Sanitize VFS userspace interaction
    * 4K-page support for userspace
    * Reference counting on page directories/tables + COW
