Critical features:

    * Decouple MM implementation from other parts as much as possible
    * Rework MM to use 4K pages as default instead of 4M for userspace

Planned (and very desired and useful) features:

    * Add page markers to tell .text pages from .data/.bss ones
    * Sanitize VFS userspace interaction
    * Reference counting on page directories/tables + COW
